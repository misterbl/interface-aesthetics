    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>
      Like most website operators, Interface Aesthetics collects
      non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
      servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
      preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
      Interface Aesthetics's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
      information is to better understand how Interface Aesthetics's visitors
      use its website. From time to time, Interface Aesthetics may release
      non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
      publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interface Aesthetics also collects potentially personally-identifying
      information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and
      for users leaving comments on http://www.interfaceaesthetics.co.uk blog
      posts. Interface Aesthetics only discloses logged in user and commenter IP
      addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
      personally-identifying information as described below.
    </p>
    <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>
      Certain visitors to Interface Aesthetics's websites choose to interact
      with Interface Aesthetics in ways that require Interface Aesthetics to
      gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
      information that Interface Aesthetics gathers depends on the nature of the
      interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
      http://www.interfaceaesthetics.co.uk to provide a username and email
      address.
    </p>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember
      that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
      storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable
      means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
      absolute security.
    </p>

      recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to

      information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted
      advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This
      Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Interface Aesthetics and does
      not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
